DNN Models
======================================

Download DNN Models
--------------------------------------
The neural network models used in the tutorial examples can be found at– `AIS Square <https://www.aissquare.com/>`_. 
To run DeepFlame with DNN, download the DNN model `dfODENet <https://www.aissquare.com/models/detail?pageType=models&name=dfODENet_DNNmodel_V0.1&id=181>`_ into the case folder you would like to run.
    
Train DNN models
--------------------------------------
If you would like to train your own models for your specific case, please use `DFODE-kit <https://github.com/deepflame-ai/DFODE-kit>`_  and check `tutorials <https://github.com/deepflame-ai/DFODE-kit/tree/main/tutorials>`_ for detailed instructions on how to develop and deploy your own neural network models.
