Quick Examples for Each Integrator
========================================

DeepFlame provides users with three avaiblable integrators: CVODE, LibTorch, and PyTorch. CVODE integraotr does not include any machine learning capability, while the other two use different APIs to make computation with neural neworks on different platforms possible.
To get a quick start with all three integrators, there are several examples stored in ``/deepflame-dev/examples/`` that can be run. More details regarding each integrator can be found in the following sections.
