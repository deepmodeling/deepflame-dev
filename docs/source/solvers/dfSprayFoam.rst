**Problem Description**


This case simulates combustion inside a constant volume chamber based on an experimental setup at RWTH Aachen University. It can mimic, for example, the beginning of power stroke in a four-stroke diesel engine.

**Configurations Different from OpenFOAM Case**


Cantera is used instead of the built-in modules of OpenFOAM to solve the chemical reactions. Therefore, a chemical mechanism file in YAML format is required in the case directory, and the full name of the mechanism file ("xxx. YAML") should be the entry after the keyword **CanteraMechanismFile** in *constant/CanteraTorchProperties*. Non-reacting simulation can be conducted by switching the entry after the keyword **chemistry** from **on** to **off** in *constant/CanteraTorchProperties*.

**Results**
