Overview
==============
DeepFlame is a computational fluid dynamics suite for single or multiphase, laminar or turbulent reacting flows at all speeds with machine learning capabilities. It aims to provide an open-source platform bringing together the individual strengths of [OpenFOAM](https://openfoam.org/), [Cantera](https://cantera.org/) and [pyTorch](https://pytorch.org/libraries) for machine learning assisted reacting flow simulations. It is also has the scope to incorporate next-generation heterogenous supercomputing and AI acceleration infrustructures such as GPU and FPGAs.
