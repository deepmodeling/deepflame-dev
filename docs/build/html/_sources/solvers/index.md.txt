## df0DFoam
1.	Based on [rhoPIMPLEFoam](https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/guides/latest/api/dir_2025a31a9eeef68e4ac8ec5ebf0b177c.html) solver and simplified specifically for a zero-dimension combustion model, which has no spatial resolution and does not contain any information on the fluid mechanics.
2.	EEqn: h = u+P/rho, volume is constant. 
3.	UEqn is removed, no advection.
4.	Add YEqn: modified from [/combustion/reactingFoam/YEqn.H](https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/guides/latest/api/combustion_2reactingFoam_2YEqn_8H.html).
