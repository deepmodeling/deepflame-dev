FlamePilot is an **agentic runner for combustion CFD workflows**, designed to automate and assist simulations within the DeepFlame ecosystem. It provides a **CLI-first, tool-aware agent** that translates natural language instructions into executable CFD actions, covering case setup, solver configuration, execution, diagnostics, and iteration.

FlamePilot emphasizes **executability and traceability**: it helps you go from intent → runnable case, while keeping workflows inspectable and compatible with research-grade CFD practices.
