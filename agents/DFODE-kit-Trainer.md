DFODE-kit Trainer
=================
DFODE-kit Trainer is a specialized agent designed to facilitate the training of models using the DFODE-kit framework. This agent streamlines the process of setting up, executing, and monitoring training sessions for differential equation-based models. User can interact with the agent through natural language commands to configure the target case settings that the model will apply. The agent can recognize the requirements and automatically complete the data sampling, data enhancement and model training processes. Finally, it returns to the user a directly usable model and a clear task report.
